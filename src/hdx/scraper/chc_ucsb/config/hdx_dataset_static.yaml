notes: |
  This CHC-CMIP6 observational and projection dataset offers zonal statistics computed
  from high-resolution (0.05°) hydro-climatic maximum temperature (Tmax) data for the
  current/observed period (1983-2016) and near-future scenarios (2030 and 2050).
  It also presents zonal statistics based off counts of Tmax ‘extremes’ for the
  observations dataset and each of the scenarios. For the original high resolution tif
  files from which this dataset was calculated, please see...
